In my spare time, I like to enjoy a glass of red wine, listen to music, and figure out how to translate my text to my sisters in emoji.

One of the causes I care about is encouraging more women to pursue careers in the sciences, namely in computational sciences. Over the years I've participated in numerous events including a Girl Scout Science Day (pictured below) in which myself and my lab mate, Karolina Heyduck, taught a computer science module for different age groups.
