In my spare time, I like to enjoy a glass of red wine, paint, strum the ukulele, rock climb, and figure out how to translate my texts to my sisters in emoji. I love trying new things and going on hikes.

## Activities

One of the causes I care about is encouraging more women to pursue careers in the sciences, namely in computational sciences. Over the years I've participated in numerous events including a Girl Scout Science Day *(pictured below)* in which myself and my lab mate, Karolina Heyduck, taught a computer science module for different age groups. Since then, I've worked on the module to be adapted to local elementary school classrooms.
