In my spare time, I like to enjoy a glass of red wine, listen to music, and figure out how to translate my texts to my sisters in emoji. I love trying new things and exploring the city of Athens, from bouldering at the local rock climbing gym to attending a themed storytelling meet-up to taking a hike at the State Botanical Garden of Georgia. While going out and doing things keeps me going, I do spend a lot of time at home playing video games or reading fiction novels.

**Some of my likes**

* Color coding
* Snuggling with cats
* Simple UI
* Star Wars
* Calvin and Hobbes 

## Activities

One of the causes I care about is encouraging more women to pursue careers in the sciences, namely in computational sciences. Over the years I've participated in numerous events including a Girl Scout Science Day *(pictured below)* in which myself and my lab mate, Karolina Heyduck, taught a computer science module for different age groups. Since then, I've worked on the module to be adapted to local elementary school classrooms.
