# Draft

Earlier this year, I took several exams that allowed me to receive the MCSA and MCSE badges for Business Applications (Dynamics). However, these will retire on December 31, 2019 and will no longer be attainable. To replace them, Microsoft released a brand new set of Dynamics certification exams that are role and level based. As a result, I set off to acquire the following badges:

* Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 for Customer Service Functional Consultant Associate
* Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 for Field Service Functional Consultant Associate

These two certifications are attainable by passing the following exams: MB-200 (Customer Engagement), MB-230 (Customer Service), and MB-240 (Field Service).

In general, the questions pull directly from the Microsoft official documentation, some even word-for-word. Going through the documentation in conjunction with the step-by-step tutorials on Microsoft learn is enough to prepare you. It also helps to spin up a trial instance of D365 to play with as well. 

I've compiled a list of _quick notes_ for many of the topics covered in MB-230 and MB-240, as well as general knowledge about Dynamics for Customer Service and Field Service. Items in bold are highly likely to appear on the exam.

# Customer Service

## Perform configuration

## Manage cases and the knowledge base

## Manage queues, entitlements, SLAs

## Configure Voice of the Customer

### Create surveys

* Admin can install directly from D365 via Applications
* Published surveys are stored in Azure (S2S authentication)
* Supports images, survey/section logo, and color theme
* Max published surveys = 200
* Max questions in survey = 250
* Max questions in survey w/ feedback = 40
* Recommended max pages in survey = 25
* Recommended max sections on page in survey = 10
* Max of 50,000 email invites w/ piped data can be sent within 24 hours
* Allows enabling of unsubscribe survey where user can update contact preferences
* Survey feedback can come as either (1) Survey Response - responses stored in survey response tbale, or (2) Feedback - stored in custom entity for the survey
* Survey part types: short/long answer, rating, single/multiple response, ranking, net promoter score, customer effort score, ratings, upload file
* **RESPONSE MAPPING** allows user to map a response to a question to fields in the survey response entity
* **LINKED QUESTION** allows linking of question to another in same/different survey
* Survey must be published to be public
* Distribute survey (1) anonymously, (2) non-anonymously, or (3) through an iframe on another webpage
* Leads can be auto-created when surveys are distributed anonymously via OOTB workflow
* If you delete a survey, all dependent entities are deleted too (e.g. feedback)
* All survey responses must be deleted to delete the survey

### Preview, test, publish surveys

### Manage survey responses


# Field Service

## Configure field service applications

### Configure general settings

* There are 4 security roles with Field Service: Administrator, App Access and Resource, Dispatcher, and Inventory Purchase
* Territories associated with Work Orders, Accounts, and Resources
* Postal codes are associated with territories

### Configure product and service pricing

* Products have 4 types: inventory, non-inventory, and services
* Price lists are found on Accounts, Work Orders, Agreements, and Product/Service records
* If a product has a different price list than work order, the work order's price list is used
* If an item is not on the work order's price list, the price will be from product's price list

### Configure bookable resources

### Integrate other tools with Field Service

* Twilio

## Manage work orders

### Describe the work order lifecycle

* Work Order Creation > Schedule > Dispatch > Service > Review/Approval > Invoice & Inventory Adjustments
* Service Account = critical record and must be specified on all work orders

### Create and manage work orders

* Main ways of creating, (1) Manually, (2) Convert from Opportunity, (3) Convert from Case
* Highly recommended NOT to change the default system statuses for work order - customize substatus instead

### Manage incidents

* Add Incident Type Products, Incident Type Services, and Incident Type Service Tasks to the Incident Type
* Products, services, and service tasks are automatically added to the Work Order based on the provided Incident Type
* Need to set **Copy Incident Items to Agreement** to **Yes** for automation to work
* Need Incident Type to convert Case to Work Order
* Can also add Incident Types to **Agreements** so that work orders created by agreements will populate items on the Incident Type
* Any automatically added items from an incident can be removed
* Single work order can have multiple incidents
* If Incident Type needs to be completed by multiple resources, use a **Requirement Group Template**

## Schedule and dispatch work orders

## Manage inventory and purchasing
