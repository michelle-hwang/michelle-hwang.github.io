# Draft

Earlier this year, I took several exams that allowed me to receive the MCSA and MCSE badges for Business Applications (Dynamics). However, these will retire on December 31, 2019 and will no longer be attainable. To replace them, Microsoft released a brand new set of Dynamics certification exams that are role and level based. As a result, I set off to acquire the following badges:

* Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 for Customer Service Functional Consultant Associate
* Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 for Field Service Functional Consultant Associate

These two certifications are attainable by passing the following exams: MB-200 (Customer Engagement), MB-230 (Customer Service), and MB-240 (Field Service).

In general, the questions pull directly from the Microsoft official documentation, some even word-for-word. Going through the documentation in conjunction with the step-by-step tutorials on Microsoft learn is enough to prepare you. It also helps to spin up a trial instance of D365 to play with as well. 

I've compiled a list of _quick notes_ for many of the topics covered in MB-230 and MB-240, as well as general knowledge about Dynamics for Customer Service and Field Service. Items in bold are highly likely to appear on the exam.

# Customer Service

## Perform configuration

## Manage cases and the knowledge base

## Manage queues, entitlements, SLAs

## Configure Voice of the Customer

# Field Service

## Configure field service applications

### Configure general settings

* There are 4 security roles with Field Service: Administrator, App Access and Resource, Dispatcher, and Inventory Purchase
* Territories associated with Work Orders, Accounts, and Resources
* Postal codes are associated with territories

### Configure product and service pricing

* Products have 4 types: inventory, non-inventory, and services
* Price lists are found on Accounts, Work Orders, Agreements, and Product/Service records
* If a product has a different price list than work order, the work order's price list is used
* If an item is not on the work order's price list, the price will be from product's price list

### Configure bookable resources

* Can be Generic, Contact, User, Equipment, Account, Crew, Facility, Pool
* A resource must have (1) Start Location, (2) End Location, and (3) Organizational Unit filled out on the scheduling tab
* Locations for resource can be (1) Org Unit Address, (2) Resource Address, or (3) Location Agnostic
* Locations MUST have valid latitude/longitude
* Start/End location for a facility MUST be set to Organiational Unit Address
* A resource must have working hours and time zones to be displayed
* **Resource Skills**, or Characteristics, can be one of two types: (1) Skill or (2) Certification
* A **Crew** is a group of people that can be scheduled together for work items
* When a crew is scheduled, all members within the crew are scheduled
* A **Pool** is a pool of qualified resources that can be assigned to without determining exact person to perform work
* A resource can only be associated with on crew/pool at a time

### Integrate other tools with Field Service

* Connected Field Service (CFS) is an add-on that connects Azure IoT to business actions
* By default CFS/Azure IoT deployed via Azure Logic Apps for registration/alerting and Azure Stream Analytics for anomaly detection
* Can use CFS to remotely monitor and service customer equipment once registered
* Can use CFS to trigger alert when certain triggers are met
* Can use CFS to automate reactions to alerts to reduce # of field technicians
* Integration with 3rd party Twilio for SMS
* Integration with 3rd party Glimpse allows real-time ETA/location of technician

## Manage work orders

### Describe the work order lifecycle

* Work Order Creation > Schedule > Dispatch > Service > Review/Approval > Invoice & Inventory Adjustments
* Service Account = critical record and must be specified on all work orders
* OOTB Booking statuses = Scheduled, Travelling, In Progress, On Break, Complete

### Create and manage work orders

* Main ways of creating, (1) Manually, (2) Convert from Opportunity, (3) Convert from Case
* Highly recommended NOT to change the default system statuses for work order - customize substatus instead

### Manage incidents

* Add Incident Type Products, Incident Type Services, and Incident Type Service Tasks to the Incident Type
* Products, services, and service tasks are automatically added to the Work Order based on the provided Incident Type
* Need to set **Copy Incident Items to Agreement** to **Yes** for automation to work
* Need Incident Type to convert Case to Work Order
* Can also add Incident Types to **Agreements** so that work orders created by agreements will populate items on the Incident Type
* Any automatically added items from an incident can be removed
* Single work order can have multiple incidents
* If Incident Type needs to be completed by multiple resources, use a **Requirement Group Template**

## Schedule and dispatch work orders

### Implement the Schedule Board/Assistant

* Enable entity for scheduling in **Administration** by adding **Booking/Requirement Relationships** and updating **Booking Setup Metadata* 
* **DRIP SCHEDULING** controls how many booking scan appaer on the mobile app at once
* By default, URS is not conneted to a map
* Connect to mapping provider by setting **Connect to Maps** to **Yes** in **Scheduling Parameters**
* Can _manually_ schedule via the schedule board
* Can _semiautomatically_ schedule via suggestions from schedulign assistant
* Can _automatically_ schedule using resource scheduling optimization (RSO)
* Can schedule via drag-and-drop or find availability on requirements panel or map view
* Can schedule via directly dragging a time slot onto the calendar
* Can schedule from the create resource booking panel via schedule assistant
* Can schedule directly from work order via Book button
* Start/end locations MUST be defined on a resource record for it to show up on schedule assistant
* Can create new tabs on the schedule board only visible to user but can be shared


### Configure RSO

* Add-on to D365 Field Service, deployed via Admin center
* Not enabled by default so must be turned on via Resource Scheduling Optimization app or Universal Resource Scheduling App
* Maps must be enabled 
* Any resource to be optimized must be enabled by setting **Optimize Schedule** to **Yes** 
* Any resource to be optimized must have valid latitude/longitude
* Any requirements to be optimized muts be enabled by setting **Default Scheduling Method** to **Optimize** 
* Existing requirement records must be manually set in **Booking Setup Metadata**
* Booking Statuses must be set to **Optimize**, otherwise there is **Do Not Move** or **Ignore**
* The **Optimization Goal** determines how the RSO should optimize and are made up of **Objectives** and **Constraints**
* An **Objective** defines what you are trying to achieve, e.g. maxmimize total working hours
* A **Goal** defines what is to be considered to meet objective, e.g. restricted resources
* Each goal has an effort level (very light, light, moderate, intense, very intense) that increases RSO completion time with greater effort
* Multiple objectives/constraints can be defined for a goal; however, only objectives are ordered


### Configure URS

* The **Fullfillment Preferences** entity can customize how schedule assistant results are displayed
* Can customize **intervals** and **time groups**
* Fullfillment Preferences must be attached to a requirement record
* A **Resource Requirement Group** groups multiple requirements for scheduling (order matters)
* A **Requirement Group Template** defines items needed for a requirement group; (1) Create a template, (2) Associate an Incident Type to the template, (3) Add incident type to the Work Order, (4) Book the Work Order
* **Split View** can be used when working with resource pools/crews
* By default, requirements panel is not configured to display requirement groups
