I had an amusing conversation with one of my peers the other day while on a hike during a retreat.

He thought that I should work on a project that combines all of my interests as a motivator. I mentioned that I wanted to break into app programming. And suddenly, out of nowhere, we came up with cats who code.

There are a lot of tablet games out there that are designed for cats - swiping fish swimming in a pool - stuff like that. What if certain actions on the screen corresponded to specific lines of code or commands? Swipe the yarn ball left, and we enter a loop. I dunno, the mechanics of it would need work. Eventually, some cat out there is going to write something functional. Hopefully. Or I'm just a lunatic with a crazy idea. 

_Why would it be successful?_ Well, no one's done it. And what piques interest in our digital era than seemingly useless funny things on the Internet?

Who knows. Maybe I'll do it.
