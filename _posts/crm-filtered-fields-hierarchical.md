Suppose we have a table of hierarchial data called Service Group. There are three levels of Service Group: SG1, SG2, and SG3. When a User selects Service Group 1, the options for Service Group 2 must be filtered based on the User selection. The same logic applies to Service Group 3.

We can configure this scenario using a single Custom Entity and self-referential relationships. 

## Step 1: Create Custom Entity.

I will create a custom entity called Service Group.

## Step 2: Create self-referential relationships.

## Step 3: Create relationship with XX entity

## Step 4: Create views

## Step 5: Add to form using filtered view

## Step 6: Import data
