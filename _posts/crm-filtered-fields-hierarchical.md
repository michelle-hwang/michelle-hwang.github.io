Configuring Filtered Fields for Hierarchial Data

Suppose we have a table of hierarchial data called Service Group. There are three levels of Service Group: SG1, SG2, and SG3. When a User selects Service Group 1, the options for Service Group 2 must be filtered based on the User selection. The same logic applies to Service Group 3.

We can configure this scenario using a single Custom Entity and self-referential relationships. 

1. Create Custom Entity.
I will create a custom entity called Service Group.

2. Create self-referential relationships.

3. Create relationship with XX entity

4. Create views

5. Add to form using filtered view

6. Import data
