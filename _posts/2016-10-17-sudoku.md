It's been years since I last wrote anything in C++, since that was the primary language taught in the early Computer Science classes at University of Michigan. When I went to interview at a IT consulting company last week, a fellow interviewee mentioned her sister writing a sudoku puzzle solver. I thought that could be fun between working on my research and applying for jobs. Well... I think I might have grown too comfortable with scripting languages, Python in particular, because I found myself forgetting all the more tedious procedures I have to follow using C++. Thankfully, there's plenty of resources for that. I'm probably going to be stumbling around for a bit before I can put something coherent together, but I think it's a great way to refresh myself with the language!

I also recruited a C++ clueless friend to help, so it'll be a fun learning process.
