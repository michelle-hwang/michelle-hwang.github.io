I had the privilege of being a guest lecturer at my friend's 2nd grade class to talk about computers and programming! Not only did I get the chance to design a teaching module, but I could use it in action as well. I was alloted about 2 hours to spend with the students, so I had to plan accordingly.

**Topic:** Coding and computer science
**Target:** 2nd graders, 6-8 years old
**Time:** 1.5-2 hours
**Student Learning Objectives:** 

* Be able to solve simple logic problems using psuedocode
* Understand basic programming concepts/logic

**Prep:**

* Write a messagei, e.g. "Hello World", on the board in binary or ASCII.
* Print out binary or ASCII table as a handout.


### Part I: Hands-Free Coding
#### Introdution

1. *Race!* Have students decipher the coded message on the board. Explain why things need to be translated for computers and humans to communicate.
  * "Hello world!" is traditionally the first program a programmer writes in a new language.
2. Pose questions to students. Encourage participation by raising hands and then calling on them for examples.
  * How many of you have a computer at home? How many of you use the computer at home? What kinds of things do you do on it? (Raise your hand if you use it to play games... chat with your friends.... etc.)
  * What is code? It's like a set of instructions in a language a computer can understand.
  * What kinds of things require code besides computers? 

#### Computers and Code

**Concepts:**

* Parts of a computer and that they work together 
* People > Code > Computers > Do things

1. Explain parts of a simplified computer, i.e. CPU + Memory + Display. Draw on board.
2. Bring old, non-functional computer parts to show in front of the class. Pass them around the room so students can see/feel them.
3. Questions:
  * Do any of you know what's inside of a computer?
  * Why does a computer need so many different parts?
  * What would happen if one part of the computer was hit with a slow motion ray gun and moved 100000000x slower?

#### Logic

**Concepts:**

* There are many ways to achieve the same solution in a program.
* Loops, if/else statements, boolean logic
