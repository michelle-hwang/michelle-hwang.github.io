I had the privilege of being a guest lecturer at my friend's 2nd grade class to talk about computers and programming! Not only did I get the chance to design a teaching module, but I could use it in action as well. I was alloted about 2 hours to spend with the students, so I had to plan accordingly.

**Topic:** Coding and computer science
**Target:** 2nd graders, 6-8 years old
**Time:** 1.5-2 hours
**Student Learning Objectives:** 
* Be able to solve simple logic problems using psuedocode
* Understand basic programming concepts/logic
**Prep:**
* Write a messagei, e.g. "Hello World", on the board in binary or ASCII.
* Print out binary or ASCII table as a handout.


### Part I: Hands-Free Coding
