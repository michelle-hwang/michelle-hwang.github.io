title: Terminal Customization

I spend the majority of my time at work on a terminal, mostly because I work by SSH'ing into the high computing cluster at the University. When I have been a teaching assistant for Introduction to Bioinformatics classes, most students are new to using the terminal interface. As a beginning user, it can be pretty intimidating since it's pretty abstract with no GUI. When I first started out using the terminal, I found it difficult to keep my thoughts organized, especially since I love color coding and organizing things. Well, not all terminals need to be bland and boring. Whether you're a beginner at using the terminal, or you use it all the time, there's no reason why you shouldn't customize it to your liking!

_Sorry Windows users, this isn't relevant for you._

## Basic Terminal Appearance

Let's start with something easy. If you're using the default Mac terminal, you can do some basic customization with your terminal appearance. Go to Terminal > Preferences > Profiles. There are numerous color schemes on the left, but typically a dark background with light text is easier on the eyes. Choose something you like.

Check out the "Text" and "Window" tabs on the right to customize the look. 

### Make it transparent

I like having my terminal slightly transparent so I can see things underneath it. Edit the background and lower the opacity from 100% to something lower, depending on how transparent you want it.

## Welcome Message

When a bash session terminal opens, a certain file in your home directory called ``.bashrc`` is automatically executed. This is not to be confused with ``.bash_profile``, which is executed for login shells, like via SSH. 

First, go to your home directory.

    cd

Next, edit your .bashrc file with your favorite text editor. I use vim.

    vim .bashrc

Now, add whatever welcome message you like to this file! Save the file and restart the terminal to see changes.

    echo -e "Hi Michelle, how are you doing today"

It's also fun to add colors. This requires an ANSI terminal. Check out the fun colors, backgrounds, and emphases [here](http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting) Here's one way to do it:

    RED=`tput setaf 1`
    WHITEB=`tput setab 7`
    RESET=`tput sgr0`
    BOLD=`tput smso`
    RMBOLD=`tput rmso`
    echo -e "${RED}${WHITE}Hi ${BOLD} Michelle ${RMBOLD}, how are you doing today? ${RESET}"

### Remove "Last login" message

Everytime you open up a terminal on the Mac, a last login message appears. I really don't care when the last time I opened up the terminal was, so I got rid of the message by running this command:

    touch ~/.hushlogin

To get it back:

    rm .hushlogin

### Other things to add to .bashrc

Command shortcuts! You can write your own command as a "nickname" for a longer command. I tend to use the command ``ls -l`` to list all files with details, e.g. size, permissions, often. Instead of typing ``ls -l``, I made a shortcut to type in ``ll`` instead. This shortcut is called an **alias**.

    alias ll='ls -l'

If command line editing gets messed up when you resize terminal window, use this:

    shopt -s checkwinsize

I like to add a message to all my start-up files to indicate that the file was executed.

    echo -e "${RED}.bashrc invoked${RESET}"

Because I organize my startup files in a certain way, I have some commands in ``.bash_profile`` that I would like to be run when I open up the Mac terminal. Adding this command to your .bashrc will have the ``.bash_profile`` executed when ``.bashrc`` is excuted: 

    if [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then
        source ~/.bash_profile
    fi

## zsh

``zsh``, or z shell, is a Unix shell that is faster and more customizable than bash, which is the default for many systems. It includes the features of a bash shell, but has more, including an amazing plugin in my next header. There are a million reasons and advocates of why you should use zsh you can find with a quick Google. If you are a Mac user, zsh is installed by default on the system, but must be updated.

Update ``zsh`` on Mac, assuming [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is installed. *Note, homebrew is an amazing package manager for macOS that is basically the universal savior.* 

    zsh --version
    brew install zsh

If you are using Debian (Linux), install and set it as default login shell:

    sudo apt-get install zsh
    chsh -s /bin/zsh user


### zsh syntax highlighting

There is a miraculous plugin that allows syntax highlighting! It will highlight the current command line *as you type*, which is a great way to catch syntax errors. You can get this [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).

## oh-my-zsh

Literally, the most amazing terminal configuration _EVER_. They call themselves "an open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration." Documentation, code, and more can be found on their [GitHub page](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+zsh#q=oh+my+zsh). 

To install via curl:

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

To install via wget:

    sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"

After installation, a ``~/.zshrc`` file will appear in your home directory to configure oh-my-zsh. This is where you can customize plug-ins and such. Now, the possibilities are endless! The best thing to do first, is to pick a colored theme to make your terminal look all pretty. There are tons of themes [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes). I am currently using *gianu*:

## Or just lolcat

## Parting Words

The terminal doesn't have to be scary or boring. Configuring the terminal can be a powerful way to make your workflow more efficient, or, just less bland. Try it!

*Happy coding!*
