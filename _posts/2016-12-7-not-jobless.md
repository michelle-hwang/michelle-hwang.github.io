I am excited to announce that I have accepted an offer working as an analyst at Avanade in Atlanta! This is a big career change for me and a huge step from my academic life thus far. It will be my first experience working in an industry/corporate environment, and I am very eager for what lies in store. Go Orange!

*Happy coding!*
