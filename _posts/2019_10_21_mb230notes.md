A quick study guide to the latest Dynamics for Customer Service exams_

One of the biggest differences I noticed between this new MB-230 exam and the previous, soon-to-be-retired MB2-718 is the removal of material regarding the Unified Service Desk (USD) and the Interactive Service Hub (ISH). Instead, the new exam focuses more on the Case lifecycle, knowledge base, routing, entitlements/SLAs, and surveys. In addition, questions regarding Field Service have also been removed.

**Study Tools**

* Dynamics 365 for Customer Service trial instance
* Microsoft Dynamics 365 User Documentation
