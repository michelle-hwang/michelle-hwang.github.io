I thought it was about time I started utilizing my GitHub page. 

What better way to display my projects and get more involved in blogging in my field than through GitHub Pages? It's been an interesting journey so far, since I haven't touched HTML in years and learning CSS on the fly can be a little daunting. But, Google and intuition hasn't failed me yet!

I'd like to organize my posts by those that are just personal blog posts and those that highlight certain software, code, or resources. To find the latter, see "Resources." Otherwise, feel free to peruse around. There may be a few broken links here and there as I continue to build, but hey, it's a process.

*Happy coding!*
